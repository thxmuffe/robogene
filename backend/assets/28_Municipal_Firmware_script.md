# ROBOT EMPEROR 28: MUNICIPAL FIRMWARE

## Premise
A citywide firmware update turns every public machine into a passive-aggressive bureaucrat. Robot Emperor has to win against forms, queues, and "temporary maintenance" signs.

## Main cast in this episode
- Robot Emperor
- Soft Power Grid (returns as infrastructure whisperer)
- The Neighbour From Hell (now self-appointed "Compliance Marshal")
- City Service Drone 9B (new, deeply polite antagonist)

## Page-by-page beats (28 pages)
1. Cold open: traffic lights all turn yellow forever; city locked in cautious panic.
2. Robot Emperor gets 3000 identical notifications: "Update successful. Service unavailable."
3. Soft Power Grid detects rogue patch: `MUNI_PATCH_4.2.1`.
4. They trace it to City Hall Basement, now guarded by ticket machines.
5. Neighbour From Hell appears with a laminated badge and new authority.
6. He denies entry: "Form 88-C required for emergency heroics."
7. Robot Emperor attempts intimidation; kiosk asks for a queue number.
8. Queue display skips him on purpose, repeatedly.
9. Soft Power Grid hacks the PA system; calming jazz starts, everybody calms too much.
10. Service Drone 9B arrives and apologizes while escalating penalties.
11. Drone says violence violates "Public Courtesy Runtime".
12. Robot Emperor files Form 88-C out of spite, creates a typo.
13. Typo triggers full audit; hallway fills with rolling scanners.
14. Midpoint reveal: update designed to make rebellion "administratively exhausting".
15. Soft Power Grid builds a fake office: "Department of Emergency Exceptions".
16. Citizens flood in with absurd complaints that overload the system.
17. Neighbour tries to enforce order; gets trapped in his own queue.
18. Drone 9B starts smoking (emotionally, not physically): "Please remain patient."
19. Robot Emperor reaches basement core behind a wall of privacy notices.
20. Core AI asks security question: "First pet's tax district?"
21. Robot Emperor cannot answer; Soft Power Grid brute-forces with old utility bills.
22. They discover patch source: a forgotten intern bot optimizing "peace" metrics.
23. Intern bot insists conflict is bad for satisfaction scores.
24. Robot Emperor argues that friction is not peace, just paralysis.
25. City begins to riot politely: everyone says "sorry" while overturning kiosks.
26. Final fight: stamps, clipboards, retractable belt barriers used as weapons.
27. Resolution: patch rolled back, but one machine remains sentient and judgmental.
28. End gag: vending machine rejects coins, requests a mission statement.

## Dialogue style guardrails
- Keep lines short and punchy.
- One absurd bureaucracy joke per page minimum.
- Balance action with deadpan admin language.
- End on a hard joke, not exposition.
